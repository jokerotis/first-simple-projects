In 2014 - 2017 we did python in school and I had done a few courses online at home and continued python development at home. Sadly my high school didn't offer computer science as a gcse for my year which really was annoying for me, so my computer science and programming never really continued further formally until March 2020 when the covid pandemic struck I started doing nothing but coding every sinlge day out of no where, completeling a long all inclusive Java course then making these games in this folder, all being made around that time I believe. After getting semi-experienced in java I started coding minecraft plugins in Java using the Spigot API. Then in September 2020 I started a Computer Science A-Level, a 2 year course. Ever since I've been coding almost daily. I'm going to work on using github more extensively now, as I begin my next chapter in 2022 of web development.
